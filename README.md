# angularjs-to-react
Integrating React in AngularJS with [ngReact](https://github.com/ngReact/ngReact)

This idea is migrate from Angular to React, but without stopping your project. So you can work on your project running AngularJS (legacy) and React.

## Get start

Fork this project, run `npm install`, `gulp` and see the code.
